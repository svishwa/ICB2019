			<h5><b><u> 2. New Trends in Convolutional Neural Networks for Biometric Applicationsn</u> </b></h5>
			<h6><b> Abhijit Das and Mohamed Hussein</b></h6>
			</br>
			<div class="row" >
				
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<h5><b>Abstract </b></h5>
					<p align="justify"> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have garnered immense interest among the research
						community in many disciplines, thanks to the numerous breakthroughs enabled by CNNs. Not surprisingly,
						CNNs have also brought huge success for biometrics research. This success was further fueled by the
						commercialization of biometric systems based on CNNs. One of the main advantages of CNNs is alleviating
						the need to design hand-crafted or engineered features extractors, and rather combine representation
						extraction and prediction in a single unified framework. This advantage has made them particularly
						attractive for newly explored imaging modalities, such as thermal and depth data, for which traditional
						feature extraction techniques, such as SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) or HoG (histogram of oriented
						gradients) may not perform satisfactorily.
						In this tutorial, we will focus on advances in CNNs that have been recently explored for biometric
						applications, such as multi-task learning and attention mechanisms. We will also cover the challenges and
						current solutions for training CNNs for newly explored unconventional imaging modalities. Hence, in this
						tutorial, we aim to list and explain these emerging topics and trace a possible roadmap for future research
						for biometric applications. We hope that this tutorial will help researchers to bring forces in these exciting
						research areas.
